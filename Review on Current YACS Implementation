Review on YACS:

1. When people are making a YACs account and need to put in their major, there should be a drop down list of all the possible majors 
so they can just choose it instead of having to type it out. Some people don't know their major by the shortened name (Compsci is CSCI).

2. I really like how YACS allows the users to view the schedule grid as they are adding classes. It got very annoyinh having to go back 
and forth on QUACS.
